## Additional Notes
Originally, I built the entire application as a backend application to be connected to a front end. Later, I realized I had done way more than I needed. Instead of deleting everything, however, I decided to keep a majority of the code to make it easier to expand it later on. Remnants remain, such as my inquirer queries being in folders for "apiRoutes" and the inclusion of a server. I have made comments where appropriate for the files. I would delete them, so as not to muddy the files, but I don't know how to delete files for submission but keep them attached to the project. 

I also have an error in my code with adding things. I worked with the TAs a lot on this, and I worked with a tutor. I spent a lot of time myself trying to trouble shoot it. No one helped me. The tutor said he didn't know what was wrong. The TAs didn't help. I used what was in the online module and can't figure out why I'm getting a syntax error. I am very frustrated about this.
